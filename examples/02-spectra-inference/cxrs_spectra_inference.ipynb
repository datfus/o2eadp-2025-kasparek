    "# Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy\n",
    "Is a spectroscopic diagnostic technique based on an analysis of a spectral line shape. For this reason the spectra measurements are taken with high resolution. The spectral line of interest is generated by interaction of a Neutral Beam Heating (NBI) particles (here we use deuterium beam denoted with $D$) with an absolutely stripped ions of light impurity (here denoted with $I$). In a charge exchange collision, the bound electron jumps from a fast deuterium neutral to an excited state in an impurity ion. Consequently, the bound electron  decays into a lower energy state by radiating a photon $h\\nu$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ I^{Z} + D^{0} \\rightarrow I^{Z-1*} + D^{1+} \\rightarrow I^{Z-1} + D^{1+} + h\\nu_{p \\rightarrow q}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This line is referred to as \"active line\" or \"active component\", since it has to be actively generated by the NBI. The $p \\rightarrow q$ denotes the upper and lower electron energy states which define the energy of the photon $h\\nu$ in the radiator's frame. The line you will be working on is the Carbon 5+ 8 -> 7 line with rest wavelength 529.07 nm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the laboratory frame, the energy of the radiated photon is a subject to a doppler effect given by the velocity of the radiationg impurity $I^{Z-1*}$. The observed line shape is thus governed by the properties of the velocity distribution function of $I$. The properties of the distribution function an be inferred from the line shape. Here, we assume $I$ has a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution which gives the line a Gaussian shape. The shift of the line with respect to the rest wavelength can thus be used to calculate the plasma rotation, the width of the line (standard deviation) can be used to obtain temperature. Analysis of multiple channels can be used to reconstruct plasma rotation and ion temperature profiles because the radiation observed by each channel is confined to a small volume given by the beam and channel intersection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nuisances\n",
    "Due to plasma particle interactions the excited states $I^{Z-1*}$ are generated inside plasma even without the presence of the beam. This is called \"passive line\" or \"passive component\". There are several mechanisms how $I^{Z-1*}$ is intrinsically generated in plasma. Each mechanism is is caused by different reactants (electron collisions, background $D{0}$ neutrals) and thus happens in a different plasma shell (given by the density distribution of the reactants). Because the photons are radiated by the same impurity $I^{Z-1*}$ and transition $p \\rightarrow q$, in the radiator's frame the photon has the same energy $h\\nu_{p \\rightarrow q}$ for all mechanisms. However, the observed line shape of the passive component can become complicated. Since the volume it is collected from by the diagnostic depends on the channel and the plasma shells which in turn have evolving temperatures and rotations, the line shape of the passive component can take non-parametric shapes. Because in measured spectrum both active and passive components are superimposed, the analysis of the active component shape can get tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Beam Chopping for Sanity\n",
    "The result is, that the passive component of the spectrum is present in every measurement. The active component is present only when the NBI is injected into plasma. One technique to deal with the active-passive component separation is to turn turn on and off the NBI periodically (to \"chop\" the beam). In reality this provides separate information about the passive component which can be used in inference of the properties of the active component. Although in reality, the plasma conditions evolve and the passive component can change its shape, it your data this phenomenon is negligible."
